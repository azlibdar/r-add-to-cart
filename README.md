# Add To Cart

This project is a simple shopping cart application built with React. It shows a list of products that users can add to their cart. In the cart, users can increase or decrease the quantity of items, and items are automatically removed when their quantity reaches zero. The app keeps track of the total price of all items in the cart.

The application uses `React's Context` and `useReducer` hook to manage the cart state across different components.
